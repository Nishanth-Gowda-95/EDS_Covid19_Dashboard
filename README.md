Enterprise Data Science Course Project 2022


1. The notebook ["EDS_Plots"](https://github.com/Nishanth-Gowda-95/EDS_Covid19_Dashboard/blob/main/Notebooks/EDS_Plots.ipynb) containing the codes for initial submission, where Covid-19 spread of three pre-selected countries were visualized.
2. The notebook "Covid-19 Spread and Doubling rate"](https://github.com/Nishanth-Gowda-95/EDS_Covid19_Dashboard/blob/main/Notebooks/Covid-19%20Spread%20and%20Doubling%20rate.ipynb) contains the codes for collecting Covid-19 spread data and analysing it. It also contains codes for Dash visualization of Covid-19 spread, doubling rate and SIR model for all the countries, whose data is collected by John Hopkins University.
3. The notebook ["SIR Modelling"](https://github.com/Nishanth-Gowda-95/EDS_Covid19_Dashboard/blob/main/Notebooks/SIR%20Modelling.ipynb) contains the codes for SIR models for all countries in John Hopkins dataset.

The data has been sourced from John Hopkins University [GitHub page](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
